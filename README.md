# ENTER DESCRPTION = API Integration:
The script uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch a 5-day weather forecast for a city. It communicates with the API using the requests library, passing parameters like the city name, API key, and units of measurement.

Data Processing:
The JSON response from the API is parsed to extract relevant data, including timestamps, temperatures, and humidity levels. Each forecast entry is processed to prepare the data for visualization.

Visualization:

The temperature trend is plotted using a line graph where the x-axis represents timestamps, and the y-axis shows temperature values in Celsius.
Similarly, the humidity trend is displayed, showing how humidity changes over time.
These plots are styled with Seaborn for better aesthetics and clarity.
User Interaction:
The script prompts the user to input a city name. It dynamically fetches data for the specified city and handles errors gracefully (e.g., invalid city names or network issues).

Purpose and Features:
Purpose: To showcase Python’s ability to interact with APIs and visualize real-world data. It’s a practical example of data analysis and visualization in action.
Key Features:
Real-time data fetching from OpenWeatherMap.
Clear and interactive visualizations.
Easily customizable for additional weather metrics like wind speed or pressure.
